I remember living through the Tamagotchi crazy in the 90s. You know, those little keychain pets that everyone used to care for?

While it´s true that currently, they kept launching new models over the years (and video games), it´s not as popular as it used to. That being said there is still currently an active community keeping it alive.

It was in one of these communities in **[TamaTalk](https://www.tamatalk.com/)** that I found about this little gem. Created by a user under the name [**SA311**](https://sa311.tumblr.com/) you can now have a little Tama living in your computer and relive those nostalgic memories, or make new ones!

At first glance, you will notice the very colorful graphics and menu, completely different from the grey pixel of the past. Turns out the creator based it off both the **[Gameboy version](https://tamagotchi.fandom.com/wiki/Tamagotchi_(GB))** and the more **[colorful modern models](https://tamagotchi.fandom.com/wiki/Tamagotchi_Plus_Color)**. Which is kinda of adorable

Like in the colorful version the Tama lives in its own room, and like the game boy version you can raise up to three pets at the same time. And get this, the game give players the option to speed their growth (you can click the clock while their asleep to skip to the next day) or real-time, in which by turning the game on the next day (or several days without playing), it adds 12+ hours of game time.

Gameplay is pretty much typical for this game but with a few twists. There´s a lot more to it than just feeding and making sure it doesn´t die.

## Caring For your Pet

![Tamagotchi stats screen](/images/2022/tamastats.jpg#center)

The first thing to do is to check the care meter at the bottom of the screen (it´s the first icon on the left). It can be activated by right-clicking the mouse. There are several stats, like the hunger and heart meters. Those have to be kept full so the Tama stays alive.

But another thing to notice are the other Stats, Passion, Logic, etc... This actually plays an important in its evolution and also what job they can access, adding some complexity to this game

In order to raise their stats, you can try feeding it. The food aside from curing hunger, and happiness, can raise the personality stats depending on which type. Kinda like how you should feed a child properly in real life, ha.

If you ran out of food, you can always get more at the store.

Sometimes the Tama will get dirty, which is where the tub icon comes in, you can also potty train it. Whenever it does a little "about to poop" animation, just click on the icon, and instead of a shower, you will get a little toilet animation.

Do it enough time and it might start going off on its own, I think. But it´s important to keep it clean otherwise it will get sick but no worries, just click on the shot icon to give medicine

Last, but not least. Besides feeding it you can give it toys to play with to make it happy, and again different toys can affect your pet's evolution. This can get a bit complicated which is why the creator made this [dandy little chart](https://sa311.tumblr.com/search/food) to see which is which.



## Going Outside

After feeding and playing it, it´s time to explore the outside world. The first stop is school. Depending on the stage the Tama will go to preschool or regular. There you get to play a bunch of class minigames, like jumping the rope, cleaning the gym, math class, and much more. This is also another way to raise personality stats.

Once the Tama reaches the adult stage they graduate and can now get a job, as I previously mention you only get accepted if you reach the right stats.

You can then visit the arcade, and play even more minigames! This is also the main way to make money besides jobs. You can activate new ones over time. There´s is your typical claw machine, to catch the coin, and darts variety.

You can then take your winning to buys toys and food at the store, you can buy new backgrounds for your room, and get your pet genetically tested, so can see what your pet might evolve to.

For socialization there is the Park and Dating Palace (only active in the adult stage) In the first one, you can meet a variety of characters, which you revisit again on your friendslist.

While going to the palace the matchmaker will suggest several suitors to marry. But a warning, once you do, your pet will move out and lay an egg for you to raise, so only do it if you´re okay with them leaving. That being said, you can still visit them under the family menu. A new novelty here though, is that tamas can marry regardless of gender, so can literally marry any character you want without much fanfare.


## Evolution and Connection, and more....

By now I´ve explained about stats, personality stats and care stats play a role in how the Tama evolves. The better care and higher their stat meter the better the character, adding a bit of challenge to the game. Not only breeding with certain characters will result in what type of [egg you can get.](https://sa311.tumblr.com/post/168720894477/growth-chart)

There´s also a Tamadex showcasing every single Tama species players have unlocked so far, you can try to catch them all.

Did I also mention you can connect with other people´s Tamas? You can export or [import codes](https://sa311.tumblr.com/search/codes), through the heart icon at the bottom.

The fun part is that this game is also extremely moddable you can make your backgrounds and characters to raise, or mod other players' creations. You can even raise a Sonic if you want to. No, really.

#### Game Rating

I give this game a high rating. This is clearly a labor of love on the part of the developer and it shows. Between playing homage to the traditional virtual pet, while adding new features to it. This is a must-play for every Tamagotchi fan.

And if you like this, the creator currently has another virtual pet project in store called [**Hearithen**](https://naipals.itch.io/hearithen) , feel free to check that one out.
