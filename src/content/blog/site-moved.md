After Months and Months of trying to decided where to move and what layout to use I finally did it.
As you can see, first off its got a shiny new layout! Granted it´s not as colorful, but it does its job, and hopefully it´s acessible.
I guess I wanted something that solely focuses on my writing. In order to make it easier I choose to have it coded in **[Astro](https://astro.build/)**.

For those who don´t know, it´s a static site generator, it  allows me to create multiple pages for my site in a short time without having to manually write it everytime I have to create a new one. Its also very useful for blogging, you can even pair it with your CMS of choice.

I Decided to move away from wordpress.com for couple of reasons. A big one is the whole selling your stuff to AI if the blog hosting service so chooses, it really felt like my site did not belong to me.

Another reason, is the behaviour of Matt the Ceo of Automattic who as you know, has lately been involved in some controversies, from the **[WP-Engine dispute](https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/02/wp-engine-sues-automattic-and-wordpress-co-founder-matt-mullenweg/)**, to **[harrassing](https://www.reddit.com/r/CuratedTumblr/comments/1axb321/matt_mullenweg_follows_predstrogen_to_twitter/)** a tumblr user and **[terminating her blog?](https://www.reddit.com/r/CuratedTumblr/comments/1avbp78/tumblr_bans_trans_woman_over_looney_toonslevel/)**

Saw the writting in the wall and decided to leg it. 

Now that its settled and done, what´s next?

As you can see the site is a little empty at the moment, I plan on slowly transfer some old posts over time, so don´t be suprised if you had already seen them. I plan on writting my usual stuff, you know my game reviews, share my photography...

I might even start posting about TTRPGS if I ever find the motivation, since I figured out that solo rpgs are a thing.

And I decided to  rename this blog from The Ghastly Gamer to Ghastly Mirror to fit my online nickname. Speaking of which, you may have noticed some socmeds links are missing from my sidebar. I´m no longer that much active on tumblr let alone Instagram.

I also pretty much abandoned twitter due to current events, plus I wasn´t getting much traction there anyway. I might create a proper bluesky account just for the sole purposes of sharing blog updates on there but for now you simply follow my **[bridged account](https://bsky.app/profile/creaturefeature.blorbo.social.ap.brid.gy)**, that should suffice for now.

Oh and if you want to be able to reply or message me from bluesky, all you gotta do is follow the **[app.bridgy acount](https://bsky.app/profile/ap.brid.gy)**.

And that´s it for now, my next posting will continue on as usual.
